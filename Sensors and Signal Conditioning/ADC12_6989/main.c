 *                       MSP430 CODE EXAMPLE DISCLAIMER
 *
 * MSP430 code examples are self-contained low-level programs that typically
 * demonstrate a single peripheral function or device feature in a highly
 * concise manner. For this the code may rely on the device's power-on default
 * register values and settings such as the clock configuration and care must
 * be taken when combining code from several examples to avoid potential side
 * effects. Also see www.ti.com/grace for a GUI- and www.ti.com/msp430ware
 * for an API functional library-approach to peripheral configuration.

//  MSP430FR69xx Demo - ADC12_B, Sample A10 Temp and Convert to oC and oF
//
//  Description: A single sample is made on A10 with internal reference voltage
//  1.2V. Software manually sets ADC12SC to start sample and conversion and
//  automatically cleared at EOC. It uses ADC12OSC to convert the sameple.
//  The Mainloop sleeps the MSP430 in LPM4 to save power until ADC conversion
//  is completed. ADC12_ISR forces exit from LPMx in on exit from interrupt
//  handler so that the mainloop can execute and calculate oC and oF.
//  ACLK = n/a, MCLK = SMCLK = default DCO ~ 1.045MHz, ADC12CLK = ADC12OSC
//
//  Un-calibrated temperature measured from device to device will vary due to
//  slope and offset variance from device to device - please see datasheet.
//  Note: This example uses the TLV calibrated temperature to calculate
//  the temperature
// (the TLV CALIBRATED DATA IS STORED IN THE INFORMATION SEGMENT, SEE DEVICE DATASHEET)
