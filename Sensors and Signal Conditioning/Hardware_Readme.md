# PhotoResistor
A photoresistor's resistance decreases with additional light shown on it. A photoresistor works based on a sulfide compound cadmium or lead which reacts with as light bombards it.
Before attaching the circuit to the MSP initial readings were taken to decide what the reference voltage for the ADC should be. By simply having the photoresistor uncovered in a room with lights on, the voltage output was 1.21 V, and by covering the photoresistor so that there is negligible

# PhotoDiode
A photodiode acts like the inverse of a typical semiconductor diode. These diodes are designed to operate with reverse bias, to operate in the Photodiode mode they are operating in the saturation region. For a photodiode the triode region a semiconductor diode normally uses is the photovoltaic mode. To use the photodiode as a sensor it is operated in the photodiode region, which is the operational range we used in this lab. 

# Phototransistor
While typical transistors have some light sensitivity a phototransistor is made to optimize these properties. The light hits the base and the device converts this light energy to electrical energy. The light hitting the transistor modifies the output, meaning that the amount of light can influence the operating region and in turn the amplification of the device and it's ability to act as a switch. All this means that the phototransistor can easily be used in this lab as an optical sensor.
